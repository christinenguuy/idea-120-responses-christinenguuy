Why should we bother with videogames?

I believe that playing videogames is a way to have fun or escape from reality. PLaying videogames creates a set of rules for you to follow or have complete control of wht you decide to do in the game. There's so many different aspects to videogames that provide a great experience for the player. 

Anthropy describes videogames as "an experience created by rules." She explains that games are particularly well-suited to telling stories and "exploring dynamics, relationships, and systems." She basically reiterates what Ian Bogost was saying about how videogames are "especially effective at representing complex systems." 

She believes that all games, such as tag, chess, or board games, explore and represent a variety of systems and relationships. Videogames, on the other hand, has a better chance at exploring relationships. Playing videogames has hidden and often complex rules that allow it to act as a guide for the player to go in the right direction of the game, while giving the player the freedom to experience the story on a personal level.
