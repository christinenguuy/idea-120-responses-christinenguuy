My portfolio layout will be listing out my projects for this class. 
It will include Project 1, 2 and 3. Project 1 will be first, then project 2, then project 3. I will include my own artwork as my last piece for my portfolio.
I will name the portfolio "Christine's Portfolio Page" to be specific.

Idea for the layout:
