# Cathy O'Neil Response

I think the internet wouldn’t be more useful and egalitarian without the methods mentioned (targeted ads, shaping interactions to content with specific design) because big corporations, such as Google and Facebook use their for-profit universities to advertise their target audience. 
There is also a method of advertising where credit card companies send out massive offer mailings to hundreds and thousands of people. Then even if a fraction of the percentage of the people respond to the advertisement, the company is still ranking in many customers. 
This method is based on A/B testing, which proves the internet to not be useful without the use of targeted ads.

I believe that it’s not beneficial to direct users because even if advertisements messages could be lost among the sea of online content, there is still a way for them to stalk consumers with cold calls, emails, and more ads. 
There is a predatory way of online targeting called “lead generation” which uses fabricated information and deceptive language and images to create lists of prospects that may subsequently be sold to institutions like for-profit universities which recruit people based on user information.
