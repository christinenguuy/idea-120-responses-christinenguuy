I agree to the problems that Bridle presents as he focuses on the dangers that it has toward children. It exploits children due to the fact that they are powerless with the use of the internet. I wouldn't want my kids to be exposed to a lot of the internet watching weird and creepy things online. It will cause them to be addicted which is something that can be the most harmful to them. Usually we call these addicted kids as "iPad kids", who are always on the iPad playing games or watching youtube videos. It is a scary sight to be completely honest because all they do is glue their eyes on the screen instead of pay attention to human interaction. I have two little cousins who act like this and it is very concerning to see.
I agree with the vision of what Bridle thinks the internet "should be" because it's a lot more safe for children to use. It will minimize the amount of bots and scary/ horror aspects to these random nursery rhymes. I think it would be best if Youtube increases their security and checks for videos that is swarming with bots.
