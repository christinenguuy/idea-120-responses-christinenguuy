An image that would be read differently in another medium would be a magazine advertisement because if it was a digital video advertisement, it would have more
media coverage than a magazine ad. A magazine can be mass produced, but it can not reach enough people than a video ad.

The three messages this image contains are linguistic message, coded iconic message, and non-coded iconic image. Linguistic message plays a part in this image 
because the way the words are phrased is really important in an advertisement. There are a select few words added in the image which gives the viewer space to
explore the image without being distracted by too many words on the image. A coded iconic image is the symbolic message behind the image. In this image, the
symbolic message is seeing history evolve through time. A non-coded iconic message is the actual meaning which in this image it is about discovering the whole story.
