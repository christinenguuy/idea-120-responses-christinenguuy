## O'neil Response

###### O'neil breaks down the definition of what a WMD is into three categories: scale, secrecy, and destructiveness.

An example of WMD would be the college ranking system because it is largely flawed and largely gamed. It is on a scale where it affects a large number of people. Having colleges be ranked creates tension between unemployed people and the job they are aiming to get. It affects them because if they go to an average ranked university, they might not be able to get the job they intended to work at.

An example of WMD would be cyclic crime rates and predictive policing. It is data being taken often without consent which can be used in ways that the prisoners don't know about. They don't know how the information will be used which can lead to a lot of rumors being spread. It is a secrecy within the data which is dangerous.

An example of WMD would be political polls, because it is a very influential statistic that everyone spends a large amount of time on. Theyâ€™re destructive because it usually can affect people's voting patterns. In certain ways, such as before an election day, there are people who think highly that their candidate will win so why bother voting at all? This definitely changes people's behaviors and can cause a disruption to democracy.
