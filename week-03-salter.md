  ## Response to Entangled reading
  
  There are many contemporary art tools that can be considered as a Gesamtkunstwerk. In the "Entangled" article, it goes into detail about a different form of art for each chapter.
  The chapters being theater scenography, architecture, video and image making, music and sound composition, body-based arts, mechanical and robotic art, and interactive environments constructed for research, festivals, and participatory urban spaces.
  For digital art, you can make animation films or cartoon/manga visuals that is a masterpiece through storytelling. You can also produce music like what DJ's do.
  For physical art, you can create sculptures, buildings, paintings, or drawings that is different and special to have physically. I don't necessarily think there is a specific 
  contemporary art took that can be considered as a Gesamtkunstwerk because there a bunch of artwork in the world and we as a people decide on what makes us feel something
  and if it's special to us in a certain way.
  
   I think, for a type of art piece to be considered as a Gesamtkunstwerk, it needs to have a specific idea to it even if the idea was thought of after the artwork because without the background context of a specfic piece, there's no
  meaning to the art, so no one would pay attention to it. An example of a Gesamtkunstwerk from the Rhizome Anthology is VELVET-STRIKE by Annie-Marie Schleiner, Joan Leandre, and Brody Condon. Their artpiece is of a first-person shooter video game called Counter-Strike.
  It adds images of "protest sprays" using a graffiti function in the game. 
  Velvet-Strike's graffiti sprays are ranged from mocking the game's self-aware violence and machismo to spreading explicitly anti-war messages.
  I think this is considered a Gesamtkunstwerk because it has a specfic idea to it and also spreads a message to the gamers who play the game.
