# Nakamura Response

I believe Nakamura's citation of Lev Manovich's statement that "interactive media ask us to identify with someone else's mental structure" is related to the fact that interactive media isn't all that interactive and that it also does not exist at all. Manovich emphasizes the rigidity of hyperlinking as a manner of experiencing information: when "interactive media urges us to click on a highlighted sentence to move to another sentence... we are required to follow pre-programmed, objectively existing associations," according to Nakamura. 

She delves into the controversial "myth of interactivity" in interactive media. Manovich's definition of his interpretation enables us to follow the process of identification that occurs with new media use: he compares it to the cinema viewer's process of identifying with the star's physique. I believe that Nakamura is saying that new media designers and artists aren’t movie stars because they aren’t shown that often in the media as they work behind the scenes with the movie stars. The interactivity of media is a myth because it does not involve all genders and race/ethnicity into the platform.
