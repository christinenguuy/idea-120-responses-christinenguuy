# Murray Response

I believe that Murray's predictions about internet television and inhabiting virtual
environments were successful because she discussed about integrating the worlds of
television, the internet, and computers to create a more interactive marketplace for
consumers which has been becoming true. Within a single story, the digital world
enables for a limitless number of people and plots to be explored.

Combining the episodic aspect of TV shows and the social engagement element
suggested by Murray could, in a way, help fans to pursue previously unexplored
routes, or to create their own.

Due to digital technology, TV is able to expand into new areas. New TV viewing forms, show styles, and methods to participate are constantly being introduced. Murray was able to accurately predict that this has the potential to improve the quality of the programming.

"The Mandalorian", uses virtual sets over green screens which changes the game of movie and tv show production because it provides the actors to see where they are supposed to look at. And it allows the coders to have a easier time when rendering the scene. This is compared to the prediction by Murray because she was able to accurately predict the advancements of digital technology.
