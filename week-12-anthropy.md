# Anthropy Response

Having accessibily in gaming and coding can help improve video games because it allows for game creators to have a wider range in using different assests and abilities 
within the game. Since there are certain packages that aren't allowed for free use, creators have to use the free and low quality versions, which doesn't give the game that full effect that the creator is looking for. Anthropy sees very little diversity as non-creators assume creative control over videogame material, and she says that publishing corporations are unlikely to take risks on stories that haven't already proven profitable.

What we can gain from a larger number of voices participating in creating games would have to be the amount of ideas and opinions being discussed. Other than that I think it can also be a problem.

I believe that having a larger amount of voices participating in creating games will create chaos in the work enviornment because having too many ideas happen at once can cause many disagreements which leads to arguments. Anthropy feels that single-author games are crucial for developing a critical awareness of videogames, and she wants the industry to move away from large, disjointed creative teams. It's crucial to have a personal connection to the game (as a designer) or the story (as a player).

Anthropy advocates for creation tools to become simpler and more like a sketchbook in order to increase the amount of single-author personal games created. She believes that if people aren't afraid to produce "crap games" that take very little time to make or play and may only be of use to the individual who makes them, they will make more personal games.
